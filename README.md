### The task:

The Capstone project is the final project in this course and will let us understand how you learned the materials of the course. As you moved through the course, you acquired more freedom in your tasks. With the Capston Project, you will do everything on your own, without our guidance. 
Find any data source you would like to analyze. 


Final Results:
- Dashboard: The dashboard must be accessible without a special tool. You can choose the data visualization tool, but we encourage you to use Data Studio since sharing it is easier.
- Presentation: Keep your presentation to 10-15 minutes and include extensive speaker notes.
- Written Report: Create a written report of your analysis, in Google Docs. It must contain the necessary data and your insights in written format.

Minimum Requirements:
- Utilize at least 5 techniques that you learned in the course. Provide the details of each technique separately.
- Dashboard, presentation and written report must tell a consistent story, be logical and include useful insights.
- You may use the data of your choice, as long as it is not a source we used in the course for Hands-On or Graded Tasks.
- Follow a structured approach. It is not necessary to list the six steps, but have a continuous story, and be able to point out where you covered each step.
